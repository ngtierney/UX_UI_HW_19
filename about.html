            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a <strong>UX/UI designer based in Jackson, Hole, Wyoming.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but have spent many of my adult years in Minneapolis. I moved to Jackson Hole in May of 2019, pre-pandemic. It turned out to be a rather idyllic place to weather the global challenges, and before I knew it it felt like home. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jill of all trades, master of some. I have tested my hand at <strong>apparel design, copywriting, photography, and mountaineering.</strong> On a weekend, you'll catch me in the mountains gathering inspiration from the natural world, and giving my calf muscles a run for their money alongside my partner and our pup, Orla. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold a <strong> Bachelor of Arts</strong> in <strong>Journalism and Photography</strong> from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, and a post-graduate <strong>certificate in UX/UI Design</strong> via the University of Minnesota.
